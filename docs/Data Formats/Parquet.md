# Parquet

Parquet is a columnar storage file format optimized for use with big data processing frameworks. It is designed to bring efficiency compared to traditional row-based file formats like CSV and JSON. Parquet is particularly useful for analytical workloads where read performance and storage efficiency are critical. The parquet file format is not human readable and is stored in binary format.

## Key Features

- **Columnar Storage**: Parquet stores data in columns rather than rows, making it highly efficient for read-heavy operations. This is particularly beneficial for analytical queries that often require reading only a subset of columns.
- **Compression**: Parquet supports efficient compression and encoding schemes, reducing storage costs and improving I/O performance.
- **Schema Evolution**: Parquet files include schema information, allowing for schema evolution over time without breaking existing data pipelines.
- **Compatibility**: Parquet is compatible with various big data tools and frameworks, such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, and Apache Drill.

## Relevance to Financial Data

Financial data often are becoming larger and larger with data such as pricing, fundamentals data, and alternative data. The Parquet format offers several advantages for storing and processing this type of data over formats such as CSV:

- **Efficient Storage**: Financial datasets can be very large. Parquet's columnar storage and compression capabilities significantly reduce the storage footprint.
- **Fast Query Performance**: Analytical queries on financial data often involve aggregations and filtering on specific columns. Parquet's columnar format allows for faster read times by only accessing the necessary columns.
- **Schema Management**: Financial data schemas can evolve over time. Parquet's built-in schema support makes it easier to manage changes without disrupting existing data pipelines.
- **Integration with Big Data Tools**: Financial analysts often use big data tools for complex analyses. Parquet's compatibility with these tools facilitates seamless data processing and analysis
