# CSV 

CSV stands for Comma-Separated Values. It is a simple file format used to store tabular data, such as a spreadsheet or database. Each line in a CSV file corresponds to a row in the table, and each field in that row is separated by a comma.
Structure
A CSV file typically looks like this:

```CSV
Date,Transaction,Amount
2023-01-01,Application,1000
2023-01-02,Redemption,-200
2023-01-03,Application,500
```
The first line is the header, which contains the names of the columns. Each subsequent line represents a row of data.

## Key Features
- **Simplicity**: CSV files are straightforward to create and read. They can be opened with any text editor or spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

- **Compatibility**: CSV is a widely accepted format and can be used across different platforms and software applications. This makes it easy to share financial data between different systems.

- **Human-Readable**: Since CSV files are plain text, they can be easily read and understood by humans. This is particularly useful for quick inspections and debugging.

## Drawbacks
- **Lack of Data Types**: CSV files do not store data types. All data is treated as text, which can lead to issues when importing into systems that require specific data types (e.g., dates, numbers).
- **No Support for Complex Data**: CSV files are not suitable for storing complex data structures like nested records or hierarchical data.

- **Limited Metadata**: CSV files do not contain metadata (data about data), which means additional context about the data (e.g., units of measurement, data source) must be documented separately.

- **Inefficiency with Big Data**: CSV are not are ideal for the storage and quering of large datasets.

## Relevance to Financial Data

CSVs forms the scaffold of most financial analysis tasks, acting as the input data medium for many projects. When used with python, CSVs are usually transformed into a different format to enable downstream transformations. Python provides several libraries to work with CSV files. The most commonly used library is pandas, which makes it easy to read, manipulate, and analyze data.
CSV is a versatile and widely-used format for storing and sharing data. Its simplicity and compatibility make it an excellent choice for many financial data analysis tasks. However as the size and complexity of data increases other storage formats such [parquet](Parquet.md) may be more suitable.
