# Welcome!

In today's rapidly evolving world of finance, the need for data science skills in investing has become increasingly clear. Bridging the gap between the tech and finance worlds is crucial, equipping financial analysts with the tools and knowledge to approach data analysis from a best practice perspective. Drawing upon proven methodologies from the tech industry, effective data management, wrangling, insightful reporting, research, and maintaining analytical assets are key skills to master. Rather than focusing on building models from scratch, a unified framework emphasizing how investment analysis should be approached in the modern era is essential. Developing a strong foundation in data-driven financial analysis positions analysts to tackle real-world challenges and drive investment decisions with confidence.
