# What Are APIs


An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs are essential for enabling the integration of various systems and services, allowing them to share data and functionality. For example extracting pricing data from an source such as Yahoo Finance for your analysis.

## Why Use APIs?

- **Efficiency**: They allow analysts to use prebuilt functionalities without having to build them from scratch.
- **Scalability**: APIs can handle large volumes of requests and data, making them suitable for scalable applications.
- **Security**: APIs can provide controlled access to data and services, ensuring that only authorized users can access them.

## Types of APIs

There are 3 main types of APIs, as an analyst you will primarily be exposed to the first two.

- **Web APIs**: These are accessed over the internet using HTTP/HTTPS protocols. Examples include REST and SOAP APIs.
- **Library APIs**: These are used within a programming language to access functionalities provided by libraries or frameworks.
- **Operating System APIs**: These allow applications to interact with the operating system.

## How APIs Work

1. **Request**: A client application or analysis notebook/script sends a request to the API endpoint.
2. **Processing**: The API processes the request, often involving interaction with a database or another service.
3. **Response**: The API sends back a response to the client, usually in a format like JSON or XML.
4. **Financial Analysis**: The returned response will often contain data such as earnings call transcripts, fundamental data or pricing data. This data is then used further downstream for analysis.


## REST API Pattern

REST (Representational State Transfer) is a popular architectural style for designing APIs. It relies on a stateless, client-server communication protocol, usually HTTP. Here are the key components of REST:

- **Resources**: Everything in REST is considered a resource, which can be a user, a document, a photo, etc. Each resource is identified by a unique URL.
- **HTTP Methods**: REST uses standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources:
  - **GET**: Retrieve data from the server.
  - **POST**: Send data to the server to create a new resource.
  - **PUT**: Update an existing resource on the server.
  - **DELETE**: Remove a resource from the server.
- **Stateless**: Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information the server needs to fulfill the request. The server does not store any client context between requests.
- **JSON/XML**: Data is usually exchanged in JSON or XML format.


## Best Practices for Using APIs

- **Read the Documentation**: Always read the API documentation to understand its capabilities and limitations.
- **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Implement error handling to manage different types of errors that may occur.
- **Secure Your API Keys**: Never expose your API keys in your code. Use environment variables or secure vaults.
- **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of the API's rate limits to avoid being blocked.
- **Data Validation**: Validate the data you send and receive to ensure it meets the expected format and constraints.
