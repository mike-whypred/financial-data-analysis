# Git

Git is a version control system that allows users to track versions of their project and enables multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. Git is widely used in software development but is also beneficial for financial analysts who work with data, research, and scripts as it allows for transparency of the lineage of changes to their work as well improving collaboration.

## Why Use Git as a Financial Analyst?

- **Version Control**: Git keeps track of every change made to your files, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple team members can work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts.
- **Backup**: Git provides a backup of your work, ensuring that you don't lose important data.
- **Documentation**: Each change can be documented with a commit message, making it easier to understand the history of a project.
- **Branching**: You can create branches to work on versions of analyses without affecting the main project. When the analysis is ready, it can be merged into the main project.
