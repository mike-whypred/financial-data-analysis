# What are they

A DataFrame is a powerful data structure commonly used in data analysis and manipulation, especially within the Python programming language. It is part of the pandas library, which is widely used in the data science community.

## Key Characteristics of a DataFrame:

 - Tabular Structure: A DataFrame is similar to a table in a database or an Excel spreadsheet. It consists of rows and columns, where each column can contain data of different types (integers, floats, strings, etc.).
 - Labeled Axes: DataFrames have labeled axes (rows and columns), which makes it easy to refer to specific data points using labels. The row labels are known as the index, and the column labels are simply referred to as columns.
 - Data Alignment: DataFrames automatically align data based on the labels in the axes. This makes operations like addition and subtraction straightforward and intuitive.
 - Flexible Data Manipulation: You can easily perform a variety of data manipulations on DataFrames, including filtering, aggregation, reshaping, and merging. Pandas provides a wide array of methods for handling these tasks efficiently.
